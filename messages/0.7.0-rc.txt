Release notes:

    * The symbol navigation (Go To Symbol/Go To Symbol In Project) has been
      fixed and should be much more usable now. Use Ctrl-R or Ctrl-Shift-R to
      try it. (Fixed from 0.5.0)
    * Syntax definition updated to reflect major changes in PreTeXt over the 
      past months. (Fixed from 0.5.0)
    * <h>, etc., tags within <idx> are not properly highlighted (but no 
      longer appear spuriously in symbol navigation)
    * Snippets improved, rationalized, and expanded. (Fixed from 0.6.0)
    * Build system no longer relies on Vagrant and can be used with a   
      traditional installation (possibly on any OS?). User will need to 
      configure paths manually.
    * Many parts of the UI have been updated or rationalized. Some shortcuts
      may have changed.
      
Known issues:
    * Go To Symbol In Project (Ctrl-Shift-R) seems to only operate on open
      files, not necessarily all files in project
    * Build system paths are not always stored correctly
    * Ref autocompletion is broken

Known issues from 0.5.0 not fixed in this release:

    * The scoping for embedded syntaxes is not completely satisfactory

Known issues from 0.4.5 not fixed in this release:

    * Mirroring title text to get xml:id is good for divisions, but less
      good for theorems (often not titled)
    * Mirrored title text in snippet xml:id does not always give
      completely satisfactory results (e.g., XML tags inside)
        - Should there be a user setting to disable this mirroring?
        - Is this even possible?
    * Typing '<xref ref=""' results in a spurious error ("ref/cite:
      unrecognized format")
    * Potential for confusion since Symbols List is always based on
      the current project (or open folder) but the ref autocomplete
      list may not be (if there is not an explicit project and the
      root PreTeXt file is set globally or not at all)
