Release notes:

    * Many parts of the UI have been updated or rationalized. Some shortcuts
      may have changed.
    * Updated to reflect major changes in PreTeXt over the past months. 
    * Build system no longer relies on Vagrant and can be used with a   
      traditional installation. User will need to configure paths manually.
      
Known issues:
    * Build system paths are not always stored correctly

Known issues from 0.5.0 not fixed in this release:

    * The scoping for embedded syntaxes is not completely satisfactory
    * Symbol recognition is not as good as before

Known issues from 0.4.5 not fixed in this release:

    * Symbol recognition lists are incomplete
    * Mirroring title text to get xml:id is good for divisions, but less
      good for theorems (often not titled)
    * Mirrored title text in snippet xml:id does not always give
      completely satisfactory results (e.g., XML tags inside)
        - Should there be a user setting to disable this mirroring?
        - Is this even possible?
    * Typing '<xref ref=""' results in a spurious error ("ref/cite:
      unrecognized format")
    * Potential for confusion since Symbols List is always based on
      the current project (or open folder) but the ref autocomplete
      list may not be (if there is not an explicit project and the
      root PreTeXt file is set globally or not at all)
